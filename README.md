# Atom Soda Dark Theme

A port of the Soda Dark theme for Atom. All credit for the design inspiration goes to the original soda crew:

As seen with the [Base 16 Tomorrow Night color scheme](https://github.com/atom/base16-tomorrow-dark-theme) (included with Atom).

:rotating_light: Not a 100% port just yet. Still a WIP.

Can be activated by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
